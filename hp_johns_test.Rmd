```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages & read in data
```{r, include = FALSE}

#Load tidyverse & read in harry_potter_aggression_full.csv

library(tidyverse)

hp_data <- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")

```

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates

```{r}

hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "books", y = "agression.rate")

hp_graph

```

I will be presenting a paper about the phylogenetic relaionships of leaf cell shape.
